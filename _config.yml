  Computational Evolutionary Biologist
  <br><br>
  I study evolutionary biology using computational methods.
  My long-term goal is to understand how population-level processes
  (genetic drift, natural selection) interact with molecular-level processes
  (mutation, recombination) to shape patterns of genetic variation.
  To this end, I develop statistical models based on population genetics theory.
  I build these models into inference tools using a combination of the C++ and R
  programming languages and apply them to both simulated and empirical data sets
  from a variety of species.
