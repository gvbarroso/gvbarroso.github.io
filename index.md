## About
I was born in Jaragua do Sul, Santa Catarina, Brazil.
<br>
As a teenager, I played competitive Chess and in my early 20's I was a professional Poker player.
I ride a bicycle but I also enjoy walking -- and hiking, of course!
My favorite album is [Beacon](https://open.spotify.com/album/3Mdzwty8ag5QyAYLxThypm?si=pMxZbAt7SGejBGPalS8h7g) by Two Door Cinema Club.
<br><br>
I did my Bsc in Biological Sciences, Msc in Genetics and Evolution and PhD in Evolutionary Biology [(CV)]({{ site.baseurl }}/pdf/CVitae.pdf).
In my current postdoc I investigate natural selection in short time-scales. 
I share my hot takes about science and academia on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gv_barroso).

## Projects

### PhD
In the first chapter of my [PhD thesis][phd], I used regression techniques to analyze the signature of selection in gene expression variation among individual cells. Using single-cell transcriptomics data from _Mus musculus_, [we showed](https://www.genetics.org/content/208/1/173) that expression noise is reduced in genes that are central within molecular networks, consistent with selection acting to avoid noise propagation within the cell.
<br><br>
In the second and third chapters I developed the [integrated Sequentially Markovian Coalescent][ismc] (iSMC) â€“ a population genetic method that uses Hidden Markov Models to jointly infer demography and variation in recombination and mutation rates along the genome. Using [iSMC][ismc], we were able to show that the similarity of the recombination landscape among Hominin populations recapitulates their established [evolutionary history](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008449), as well as to estimate that mutation rate variation is the main driver of the distribution of nucleotide diversity along the _Drosophila melanogaster_ genome (Barroso & Dutheil, _in preparation_).

We also wrote a chapter in this open access book: [Statistical Population Genomics](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-0716-0199-0).
