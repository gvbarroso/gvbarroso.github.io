## About
I study evolutionary biology using computational methods [(CV)]({{ site.baseurl }}/pdf/CVitae.pdf). My long-term goal is to understand how population-level processes (genetic drift, natural selection) interact with molecular-level processes (mutation, recombination) to shape patterns of genetic variation. To this end, I develop statistical models based on population genetics theory. I build these models into inference tools using a combination of the C++ and R programming languages and apply them to both simulated and empirical data sets from a variety of species. 


## Projects

### PhD
In the first chapter of my PhD thesis, I used regression techniques to analyze the signature of selection in gene expression variation among individual cells. Using single-cell transcriptomics data from _Mus musculus_, [we showed](https://www.genetics.org/content/208/1/173) that expression noise is reduced in genes that are central within molecular networks, consistent with selection acting to avoid noise propagation within the cell.
<br><br>
In the second and thirds chapters I developed the [integrated Sequentially Markovian Coalescent][ismc] â€“ a population genetic method that uses Hidden Markov models to jointly infer demography and variation in recombination and mutation rates along the genome. Using [iSMC][ismc], I was able to show that the similarity of the recombination landscape among Hominin populations recapitulates their established [evolutionary history](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008449), as well as to estimate that mutation rate variation is the main driver of the distribution of nucleotide diversity along the _Drosophila melanogaster_ genome (Barroso & Dutheil, _in preparation_).

## Bio
I was born in Jaragua do Sul, Santa Catarina, Brazil.
<br>
As a teenager, I played competitive Chess and in my early 20's I was a professional Poker player.
My favorite album is currently [Beacon](https://open.spotify.com/album/3Mdzwty8ag5QyAYLxThypm?si=pMxZbAt7SGejBGPalS8h7g) by Two Door Cinema Club.
<br><br>
I did my Bsc in Biological Sciences, Msc in Genetics and Evolution and PhD in Evolutionary Biology.
In my current project I develop statistical models to investigate natural selection in short time-scales.
